abstract: "Despite the continuous advancements in bio-molecular detection methods and fluidic integration approaches, the realization of portable and high performance devices for diagnostic applications still presents major difficulties, mostly due to the need of combining adequate sensitivity with low cost of production, operational simplicity and rapidity. In this context, we have previously proposed a compact device composed of a smartphone and a custom-designed cradle, containing only a disposable sensing cartridge, a tiny magnetic stirrer and a few passive optical components. The detection principle is named Reflective Phantom Interface and is based on measuring the intensity of light reflected by the surface of an amorphous fluoropolymer substrate having a refractive index very similar to that of water. The reflectivity of dozens of spots is monitored in real time by the smartphone’s camera using the embedded …"
