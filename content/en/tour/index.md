      - title: Fast DDM üî¨
        content: FastDDM is a robust Python package we engineered to streamline the analysis of Differential Dynamic Microscopy experiments. Dive into the core of FastDDM and discover how its integration with C++ and CUDA elevates performance, offering rapid and precise execution on both CPU and GPU.

      - title: Nonlinear dynamics of soft materials üßà
        content: 'We study the dynamics of soft materials like pastes, emulsions and gels, undergoing shear flow induced by a controlled mechanical deformation. Coupling rheometry with microscopy allows us to measure the macroscopic mechanical properties of the material and at the same time track embedded microparticles to assess the localized shear-induced diffusion. we primarily investige ‚Äúyielding‚Äù, a transition from a solid-like to a liquid-like mechanical behavior of soft materials. The project involves design and prototyping and/or improvement of custom-made instruments, as well as coding (LabVIEW, MatLab) and Image Processing.'
